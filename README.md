## What is WSniff ?

A simple hook into ws2_32.dll's send and receive functions that supports plugins to process/modify packets. 

Its major purpose is to be an easy to use go-to for packet logging and modification for any application that uses winsock that can be hooked into.

### Why should I use it?

If you've got an application (game, browser, or some personal application) whose packets you want to monitor but don't need all the provided functionality of a heavyweight tool like Microsoft's Network Monitor or Wireshark, or if you've got an application you want to modify the packets for (e.g, implementing your own encryption algorithm). 

### How does it work?

As soon as the DLL hooks in and modifies the call to ws2_send and ws2_receive, it runs a LoadLibrary on everything it can find in the ./plugins/ folder. 

### But I could accomplish this with a simple proxy DLL, what makes yours so special?

Mines isn't particularly special. Outside of supporting plugins, it's a rather simple implementation of a hook. 

The reason to prefer this over a proxy is in the case that in certain systems or applications, you'll be unable to load anything except the provided system library, which makes it impossible to get through with just a simple proxy/no executable memory modifications. 

Another alternative would be to write a simple proxy server and handle things that way, and it's a valid approach too, but you've gotta worry about things like what sockets to monitor and how to get that information in the first place.

## Alright, I guess this could serve my purposes well, hHow to BUILD?

### X64 64 bits

```bash
make x64
```

### X86 32 bits

```bash
make x86
```

### Dependencies

You need [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/), on Linux (Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get update

# Base compilers
sudo apt-get install -y \
  gcc-mingw-w64 \
  g++-mingw-w64

# 32-bit (i686) toolchain
sudo apt-get install -y \
  gcc-mingw-w64-i686 \
  g++-mingw-w64-i686 \
  binutils-mingw-w64-i686 \
  mingw-w64-i686-dev

# 64-bit (x86_64) toolchain
sudo apt-get install -y \
  gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 \
  g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 \

```

### Verifiy

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc --version
```

| Option                    | Action                                  | Result                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Install 32-bit dev libs | `sudo apt install mingw-w64-i686-dev`   | Fixes missing `-lws2_32` for 32-bit build |
| âœ… Make plugin 64-bit      | Use `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` for plugin | Matches rest of your project; preferred   |


### ZLIB

```bash
sudo apt mingw-w64-i686-zlib
```


You need  the following compilers:

```bash
$ which x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc # 64 bits
/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
$ which i686-w64-mingw32-gcc   # 32 bits
/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

#### Tets simple program compilation:

```c
// hello.c
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    MessageBoxA(0, "Hello from Windows!", "MinGW-W64", 0);
    return 0;
}
```

Then

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc hello.c -o hello64.exe -mwindows
```

## Ready? BUILD!

```bash
make x64
```

### X86 32 bits

```bash
make x86
```

### Ok, it looks like I've got a ws.dll, a folder called shared with a ws.a in there, and a folder called plugins with log.dll in there.

Seems like it worked then. Here's what the files are:

**ws.dll** - The main thing you want to load, this is what handles modifying the executable memory and loading all the things in the plugin folder.

**shared/ws.a** - The static library you'll want to use to link with your plugins (see source/plugins/log/* for an example of a plugin implementation).

**plugins/log.dll** - A plugin that logs both sent and received packets in a console window

Note that the rest of the files in build are just the unlinked object files, you can ignore them.

### How do I load the DLL?

A number of ways. You could use [PE Tools](https://github.com/petoolse/petools/releases) to modify your client's PE header and add the DLL as an import.

## LoadAppInit_DLLs

### âœ… Registry Format for Multiple DLLs

To use **multiple DLLs** with `AppInit_DLLs`, you simply list them **separated by spaces** (not semicolons or commas).

```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows]
"AppInit_DLLs"="C:\\Path\\To\\first.dll C:\\Path\\To\\second.dll"
"LoadAppInit_DLLs"=__my_ptr:00000001
"RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs"=__my_ptr:00000000
```

> ðŸ“Œ Paths must be **fully qualified**, **escaped with double backslashes**, and **space-separated**.

---

### ðŸ”Ž Example in `regedit`

* Open `regedit`
* Navigate to:

  ```
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
  ```
* Set:

  * `AppInit_DLLs` to:

    ```
    C:\MyHooks\log.dll C:\MyHooks\patch.dll
    ```
  * `LoadAppInit_DLLs` = `1`
  * `RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs` = `0` *(unless your DLLs are signed)*

---

### ðŸ§ª Tips and Warnings

* **Only works for GUI processes** that load `user32.dll`.
* Each DLL must be:

  * **of the correct architecture** (x86 for 32-bit processes, x64 for 64-bit).
  * **self-contained** and not crash if loaded in unrelated processes.
* If **any DLL fails to load**, it may prevent others from loading.
* Requires **Admin privileges** to write this key.

---

### âœ… Check If Your DLLs Are Loaded

You can verify injection using:

```bash
listdlls.exe <pid>
```

Or programmatically with tools like:

* Process Explorer â†’ Properties â†’ DLLs tab
* Frida script to enumerate modules


You could also modify the registry key for AppInit_DLLs to load it:
```bash
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows for 64-bit applications on 64-bit windows (32-bit on 32-bit windows)
```

```bash
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs for 32-bit applications on 64-bit windows
```


### How do I write my own plugins?

Here's the fun part! Go ahead and look in source/plugins/log/ for an example implementation. The Makefile at the top level of the project builds all plugins too, so you can go ahead and take advantage of that if you want.

You'll need to link against ws.a and include ws.h (probably also include winsock2.h and windows.h) in your project (C or C++ should work fine). Here are the relevant functions you'll need to use:

```
LIBRARY_API uintptr_t register_handler(tWS_plugin func, WS_HANDLER_TYPE type, char \*comment)
```

A function that'll register your function to be called when a packet is sent or received (based on WS_HANDLER_TYPE).

tWS_plugin func - A function of the type (SOCKET* s, const char* buf, int* len, int* flags). These arguments are almost identical to the winsock calls themselves, except they pass pointers (well, buf already was a pointer). This allows you to modify them if necessary. See log for implementation examples

**WS_HANDLER_TYPE** type - Two options, **WS_HANDLER_SEND** and **WS_HANDLER_RECV**, pretty straightforward. You'll need to call this function twice to register for both

char* comment - Currently unnecessary, you could just pass a "", but this at least allows someone to make a plugin to monitor other plugins and see some relevant information about it

RETURNS: A plugin identifier, save this somewhere because you'll need it to unload your handler.
```
LIBRARY_API void unregister_handler(__my_ptr plugin_id, WS_HANDLER_TYPE type);
```
If for whatever reason your DLL is being unloaded, this'll remove your function handler. Just pass the plugin_id from register_handler and the handler type (send or receive)

Also available to you are:

```
LIBRARY_VAR struct WS_plugins ws_plugins

LIBRARY_VAR struct WS_handler ws_handlers
```
Which are lists of the plugins and handlers loaded. Check out ws.h and list.h for how to use these.
